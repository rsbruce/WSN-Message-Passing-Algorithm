# WSN-Message-Passing-Algorithm
A message passing algorithm for an ultra-low power wireless sensor network.
 Based on Dijkstra's algorithm, this program computes a changing weight function with each message sent. For example, a node's weight function will consider proximity to the base station but also the remaining energy of each node, which is vital in a ultra-low power context
